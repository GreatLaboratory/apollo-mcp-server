This feature is [experimental](/graphos/resources/feature-launch-stages#experimental). Your questions and feedback are highly valuedâ€”don't hesitate to get in touch with your Apollo contact or post in the [Apollo Community MCP Category](https://community.apollographql.com/c/mcp-server/41).

## MCP authorization not supported

Apollo MCP Server doesn't support [MCP transport-level authorization](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization).

Consequently, when running the MCP server as a remote service, we recommend running it only in trusted environments and networks, not in public networks.

We plan to support MCP authorization in a future release.

## Streamable HTTP transport not supported

Apollo MCP Server doesn't support the [MCP streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http). It currently supports the HTTP+SSE transport that streamable HTTP replaces.

We plan to support the streamable HTTP transport in a future release.

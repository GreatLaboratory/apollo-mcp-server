<ExperimentalFeature />

Let's run Apollo MCP Server for the first time! You will:
- Learn how GraphQL operations are defined and configured as MCP tools.
- Deploy the MCP server locally or in a container.
- Connect an MCP client to use the tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- Install [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download). It'll be an MCP client.
- Install the TODO version of the Rover CLI. It'll start a development graph and runtime.
- Clone the [Apollo MCP Server repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server). It'll provide example schema and operation files.

## Download server

1. Download the binary of the [latest Apollo MCP Server release from GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/releases/latest). Set it in your path.

<ExpansionPanel title="Build from source repo">

You can build an Apollo MCP Server binary from its [source repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server).

1. Install [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html#install-rust-and-cargo).

1. In the root directory of your repo, run the build command:

    ```sh showLineNumbers=false
    cargo build
    ```

    The binary will be built as `target/debug/apollo-mcp-server`.

1. Run the binary to validate it: 

    ```sh showLineNumbers=false
    target/debug/apollo-mcp-server --help
    ```

## Define GraphQL operations 

Each MCP tool of Apollo MCP Server runs a GraphQL operation of your graph. You configure which GraphQL operations are callable by the MCP server. 

This guide uses an example graph and a set of operations on that graph. The examples are in the Apollo MCP Server repo, with the graph schema in `graphql/weather/weather.graphql` and operations files in `graphql/weather/operations/*.graphql`.

## Connect client

1. Open Claude for Desktop's JSON config file (go to **Settings**, select **Developer**, and click **Edit Config**) and add the following server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
        "command": "<absolute path to repo>/target/debug/apollo-mcp-server",
        "args": [
            "--directory",
            "<absolute path to repo>",
            "--schema",
            "graphql/weather/api.graphql",
            "--operations",
            "graphql/weather/operations/forecast.graphql",
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

subtitle: Run Apollo MCP Server

<ExperimentalFeature />

Let's run Apollo MCP Server for the first time. You will:
- Understand an MCP server example.
- Run an MCP server locally, using the example and Apollo Rover CLI.
- Connect an MCP client and inspect and/or run the tools.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Apollo Rover CLI](/rover/getting-started) v0.30 or later. 
- Clone the [Apollo MCP Server repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server).

## Understand MCP server example

This guide uses an MCP example from the Apollo MCP Server repo. The example uses APIs from [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com/), and it defines a federated graph and the GraphQL operations of the graph to expose as MCP tools. It also has files for configuring MCP tools from reading persisted queries registered with the graph.

Let's walk through the example files, located in the repo in `graphql/TheSpaceDevs`:
- `supergraph.yaml` is a [supergraph configuration file](/rover/commands/supergraphs#yaml-configuration-file) for the Rover CLI.
- The `operations/` directory has `*.graphql`operations schema files. Each file defines a GraphQL operation on the graph, and Apollo MCP Server creates an MCP tool from each operation file it's given.
- The `persisted_queries/` directory has a persisted queries manifest (PQM) file. It defines the operations that've been registered with the graph and that can be read by the MCP server to create corresponding tools.

## Run MCP server example

You can run the Apollo MCP Server together with a graph in a local development environment with a single `rover dev` command.

1. From the root directory of your local repo, run `rover dev` to start a local graph, using `--mcp*` options to start and configure an Apollo MCP Server.

    ```sh showLineNumbers=false
      rover dev --supergraph-config ./graphql/TheSpaceDevs/supergraph.yaml \
      --mcp --mcp-port 5555 \
      --mcp-operations ./graphql/TheSpaceDevs/operations/ExploreCelestialBodies.graphql ./graphql/TheSpaceDevs/operations/GetAstronautDetails.graphql ./graphql/TheSpaceDevs/operations/GetAstronautsCurrentlyInSpace.graphql ./graphql/TheSpaceDevs/operations/SearchUpcomingLaunches.graphql
    ``` 

    - `--mcp` starts an Apollo MCP server
    - `--mcp-port` sets the port of the server's SSE transport 
    - `--mcp-operations` sets the list of operations

## Inspect MCP server

The [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is a tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. Let's use it to validate our running server.

1. Install `npm`, if unavailable.
1. Run the Inspector from a new terminal, then go to its returned URL (for example, [`http://127.0.0.1:6274`](http://127.0.0.1:6274)).

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

1. Fill in the details:
    - **Transport Type**: Select `SSE`
    - **URL**: Enter `http://localhost:5000/sse` (its port must match the `--mcp-port` of the server)

1. Click **Connect**, then click **List Tool**. Your operations should now be listed.

## Connect an MCP client

Connect an MCP client to your server and run its tools.

<Tab label="Claude for Desktop">

1. Open Claude's JSON config file, and add a configuration to connect to the MCP server via SSE transport:

    ```json 
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "thespacedevs": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "http://127.0.0.1:5000/sse",
                "--transport",
                "sse-first"
            ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
1. Restart Claude, then check that your server's tools are available from the input box.
1. Ask a question that exercises the tools.

<ExperimentalFeature />

Apollo MCP Server provides a standard and secure way for AI models to access and use your graphs running in Apollo.

## What is MCP?

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to AI models like Large Language Models (LLM). MCP enables LLMs and AI agents to indirectly fetch data from external sources.

MCP follows a client-server architecture. MCP servers expose function, called _tools_, that MCP clients can invoke.

## What is Apollo MCP Server? 

 Apollo MCP Server an implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It makes GraphQL API operations available to AI clients as MCP tools. 

The GraphQL operations can be configured from persisted queries, which are predefined, approved lists of operations that are registered with and maintained by a graph. The operations can also be determined by AI introspecting your graph schema.

Apollo MCP Server is deployable in local environments via Apollo's Rover CLI or in containerized services in your cloud infrastructure. It can expose an MCP endpoint using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication with AI clients.
